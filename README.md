Labour_Stats_Data_Extract is ipython code on Google Colab for web scraping of different potential datasets for the project and also generates a data exploration report.

States_Industry.ipynb is ipython code on Google Colab for Data visualisations of the final unemployment data in different sectors and states over JAN 2010 to JUN 2020.

SP500_Companies.ipynb is ipython code on Google Colab for Data Extraction and Data Wrangling for the Stock data for SP500 companies which gives monthly average adjusted close stock price change for SP500 companies sectors from DEC 2019 to JUL2020.

All of the above code have generated the outputs to a google drive.
